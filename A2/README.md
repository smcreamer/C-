#house hunting - deque and stack implementation

This is an implementation of a deque containing a list of houses to be viewed for a potential house hunter.  If the user elects to view the house again, the house is pushed on a stack.  After all houses are viewed once, the stack of houses to be viewed again are popped one by one until the end of the stack is reached.
